/**
 * CONCLUSIONS
 *  1. String interpolation allows embedding anything that evaluates to a value's string representation into an existing string
 *     in a concise manner (i.e. cleaner alternative to string concatenation).
 *  2. The string must be enclosed in backticks ` instead of the usual quotes "" or ''.
 *  3. The value to be interpolated must be enclosed in curly brackets prepended with a dollar sign ${}.
